# Day Planner
## A busy employee requests an application that houses a daily planner to make scheduling daily events easier.
* When application is launched the current date is displayed at the top using moment.js.
* Upon scrolling down normal business hours are seen (9a-5p) in a color coded format: [Grey = Past], [Red = Present], and [Green = Future].
* When a timeblock is selected than an event can be entered.
* Once an event is entered into the timeblock the user is able to click the save button which will save the event to local storage.
* When the event is saved in local storage it is permanently displayed in the timeblock until cleared regardless of the number of times the application is refreshed.
